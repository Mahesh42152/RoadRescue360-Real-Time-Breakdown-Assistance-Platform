RoadRescue360 – Real-Time Breakdown Assistance Platform:

RoadRescue360 is a full-stack, real-time web platform designed to assist drivers during vehicle breakdowns. The system enables users to report vehicle issues, track nearby technicians live, and continue their journey through replacement vehicles or alternative transport options.

This project demonstrates real-time systems, scalable backend architecture, secure authentication, geolocation services, and role-based access control, simulating a real-world production-grade application.
